         Fixed typo in pod (oops!)

         PODed INSTALL

         whirlpoolsum(1) utility

         Updater ppport.h with Devel::PPPort

         Relicensed from GPL => GPL/Artistic, see COPYING for rationale.

1.0.4    2007 January 24
         - Added a clone() method that clones the state of the current object and
         - returns the cloned object.

         add and addfile now return current the object so ->add( "foo" )->digest
         works like it does in other digest modules.

         Added a b64digest method that is an alias for the base64digest method.

         Removed (add addfile reset) from @EXPORT_OK, 

         Updated the LICENSE section to the recommended FSF GPL notice

         b64digest no longer returns a trailing ==

1.0.3    2004 August 18
