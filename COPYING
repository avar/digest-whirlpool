Note:

This module was originally licensed under the GPL by the original
author. In January 2007 after taking over maintainership of it I begun
by rewriting the much-lacking test suite, removed the out-of-date
F<examples> directory, completely rewrote the documentation, removed
what Perl code there was and subclassed L<Digest::base> instead. And
added to/rewrote the XS code. When I was done the only lines that were
left was the XS code for the B<add> and B<digest> subroutines, which
are both cases where the implementation is trivial and the only way to
achieve the task (see add SHA.xs in Digest-SHA for reference).

Since the code as a whole is a wrapper around a public domain library
and the only parts of the codebase that are left are things which'll
be seen in any XS, Perl, Digest module I felt it was safe to
re-license the work under the same terms as Perl itself.
