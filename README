NAME
    Digest::Whirlpool - A 512-bit, collision-resistant, one-way hash
    function

ABSTRACT
    WHIRLPOOL is a 512-bit, collision-resistant, one-way hash function
    developed by Paulo S. L. M. Barreto and Vincent Rijmen. It has been
    recommended by the NESSIE project (along with SHA-256/384/512) and
    adopted as ISO/IEC 10118-3.

SYNOPSIS
    In programs:

        # Using L<Digest> (recommended)
        use Digest;

        my $whirlpool = Digest->new( 'Whirlpool' );

        # Get a hash and reset the object
        $whirlpool->add( "hash this" );
        my $hexdigest = $whirlpool->hexdigest;

        # Populate the object again, and clone it before getting the
        # digest to avoid resetting
        $whirlpool->add( "hash this" );
        my $b64digest = $whirlpool->clone->b64digest;
        $whirlpool->add( "add this to the hash" );

        # Using this module directly (same interface)
        use Digest::Whirlpool;
        my $whirlpool = Digest->new( 'Whirlpool' );
        $whirlpool->add( ... );
        ....

    From the command line:

        whirlpoolsum files
        whirlpoolsum --help

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an interface to the WHIRLPOOL hash algorithm. This module
    subclasses Digest::base and can be used either directly or through the
    Digest meta-module. Using the latter is recommended.

EXPORT
    None.

METHODS
    Since this module implements the standard Digest interface and should be
    used through the Digest module you should look at that documentation for
    the general interface, below is a description of methods that differ.

  clone
    Copy the internal state of the current object into a new object and
    return it.

  reset
    Resets the object to the same internal state it was in when it was
    constructed.

    This works exactly like "new" except it doesn't allocate new memory for
    its internal state.

  base64digest
    An legacy alias for the b64digest method which should be used instead.

  hashsize
    Returns the size (in bits) of a WHIRLPOOL hash, i.e. 512.

AUTHORS & HISTORY
    The original version of this package was written by Julius C. Duque in
    2003. It was rewritten by Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason <avar@cpan.org> in
    January 2007 who added compatability with the Digest interface, improved
    documentation and a whirlpoolsum(1) command-line utility amongst other
    things.
