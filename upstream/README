This directory contains files copied as-is from the whirlpool.zip[1]
implementation hosted at
http://www.larc.usp.br/~pbarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html and retrieved on
2014-10-04.

I've only copied the Whirlpool.c[2] and nessie.h[3] files from that
zip file. The Whirlpool.c has had some minor patches (sent
upstream[4]) to fix warnings. That's all in the testing code that
isn't actually used by this module.

The nessie.h file has had a lot of unused code removed (presumably
copied from some generic compatibility library) because e.g. the
ROTL32 macro clashed with hv_func.h in Perl itself. Since it and some
typedefs weren't being used at all I just removed them.

4. I got this reply from Paulo S.L.M. Barreto after sending him the
   patch:

       This problem has been related before, but there's not really
       much I can do. It was a "feature" of the NESSIE project
       standard interface and test modules, and since the NESSIE
       project ended some 11 years ago (the code itself is 14 years
       old), all that stuff is more of historical interest. Also, that
       implementation uses large tables; there are better ways to
       implement Whirlpool (lookup e.g. WhirlBob for some recent
       ideas).
